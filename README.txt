This project is a chatbot that calls a weather and news API and responds to the user to provide the requested information.

Thank you to https://openweathermap.org/ and https://newsapi.org/ for the APIs! 

The channel is on webchat.freenode.net - go to the channel #pircbot (or another channel if you'd like - just remember to update the channel name in the program) and choose a nickname.
Once you run the program, you'll be able to interact with the bot, and ask for weather in a city or zip code and for recent news headlines.
